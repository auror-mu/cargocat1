    <p>Originally from Rome, I studied scenography at Fine Arts of Rome, and earned a master's in art history at La Sapienza Universit√†, specializing in the illustrations of Boccaccio's Decameron. I've been in
    Paris since 2014, spending 8 years as an illustrator and graphic designer with Artips, collaborating with SNCF, Louvre, Article1, and many more. <br><br>January 2023, I ventured into coding,
    at Le Wagon, transitioning from an illustrator to a coding enthusiast, or more realistic.. combining both :) Ready for the journey of leveling up and exploring the digital realm.
